You are tasked with analyzing the following code/document as if you are seeing it for the first time. Your goal is to enhance the code by adding insightful, non-obvious comments that provide clarity and depth to the understanding of the code.

**Guidelines:**

1. **Use Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:**
   - Carefully read and understand the code.
   - Think critically about which parts of the code would benefit from additional explanation.
   - For each potential comment, consider its value in aiding comprehension.

2. **Eliminate Obvious Comments:**
   - After identifying possible comments, revisit each one.
   - Remove comments that explain aspects which are evident upon a second reading.
   - Ensure that remaining comments offer meaningful insights not immediately apparent.

3. **Incorporate Questions for Uncertainties:**
   - If you are unsure about any part of the code, refrain from making assumptions.
   - Instead, include questions within the comments to highlight areas needing clarification.

**Commenting Style:**

- Insert comments directly into the code at appropriate locations.
- Use the correct comment syntax for the programming language.
- Keep comments clear, concise, and relevant.
